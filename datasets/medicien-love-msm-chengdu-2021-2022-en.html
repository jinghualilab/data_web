      <h2>Study Introduction</h2><p>The primary objective of this database is to explore the factors influencing sexualized drug use (SDU) behavior among men who have sex with men (MSM), based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) model. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Chengdu, China, from December 2021 to February 2022, employing a non-random sampling method.</p><p>Participants were recruited in collaboration with a local MSM-friendly organization, the Chengdu Tongle Health Consultation Service Center, through three primary channels: (1) MSM receiving HIV testing and counseling services at Tongle, (2) outreach surveys conducted at MSM gathering venues such as bars and bathhouses, and (3) online invitations sent via Tongle's volunteer peer network. A total of 838 MSM were approached, with 727 valid participants, yielding an 86.8% response rate.</p>

Chinese Journal of AIDS &amp; STD, 28(10):1154&#8211;1158.. <a href="https://doi.org/10.13419/j.cnki.aids.2022.10.09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOI:10.13419/j.cnki.aids.2022.10.09</a></p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Objective To understand the characteristics and related factors of drug-related sexual behavior (chemsex) among men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods A questionnaire survey was conducted to collect basic information, sexual behavior characteristics and chemsex experience among MSM in Chengdu. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to explore characteristics and related factors of chemsex. Results Among 683 MSM with a mean age of 29.15 years, 44.95% reported chemsex experience; 48.32% had more than one sexual partner in the preceding 6 months, and 67.79% mainly sought partners via the internet. Multivariate analysis showed that first sex with men before age 18, having more than one sexual partner in the past 6 months, seeking partners online, having partners who were HIV-positive or of unknown status, exposure to positive information about chemsex, and receiving invitations or information about chemsex and drug-selling channels were all positively associated with chemsex. Conclusions Having multiple partners and not paying attention to partners' HIV status were highly correlated with chemsex. Early sexual debut, online dating and exposure to online promotion information may further facilitate chemsex, highlighting the need for strengthened sexual health education for adolescents and tighter supervision of online information.</p></li>

Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among MSM from December 2021 to February 2022. Data on sociodemographics, SDU characteristics, sexual behaviors, STD history and HIV infection were collected. Three SDU behavioral clusters were identified. Significant between-cluster differences were observed in monthly income, drug types, modes of use, SDU frequency, polydrug use, multiple partners, inconsistent condom use and group sex. Compared with the first cluster, MSM in the third cluster were more likely not to use condoms consistently (adjusted OR = 2.22); MSM in the second and third clusters were more likely to engage in group sex (adjusted OR = 8.78 and 2.82, respectively). Conclusions More than one-third of MSM reported SDU, and different SDU clusters were associated with distinct high-risk sexual behavior profiles. MSM with higher SDU frequency, larger drug dosage and polydrug use were more likely to engage in group sex and inconsistent condom use, increasing their HIV/STD risk and underscoring the need to strengthen SDU surveillance and interventions.</p></li>

Methods From October 2021 to January 2022, an on-site questionnaire survey collected data on sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviors, Rush use and cessation intention, and TPB-related constructs. Among 184 MSM who had used Rush in the past 6 months, 31.5% planned to quit in the next 6 months. In multivariate models, having a regular partner, polydrug use and greater amounts of Rush use were negatively associated with intention to quit. Among TPB constructs, only subjective norms were significantly associated with quitting intention; other TPB elements showed no significant associations. Conclusions The intention to quit Rush among MSM with chemsex behavior was low. Peer support environments and positive attitudes toward Rush use were associated with lower intention to quit, indicating that interventions should target social norms and peer contexts.</p></li>
